Html 
=======
This section includes several sections, including the head, which includes links to CSS stylesheets, meta information, and a title for the page. There is also a style section that defines some CSS for the page. The body of the code includes the layout for the page, including a header with a navigation menu, an image of a logo, and links to various sections of the site. There is also a section for a cart, which appears to be empty in this code snippet. The code also uses some JavaScript and CSS styles to create a responsive design for the page that adapts to different screen sizes.

=========
script.js
=======
this section uses JavaScript to handle various user interactions, update the content on the page dynamically and handle the functionalities of adding product to cart, displaying the cart, displaying the images in a lightbox, and so on.

this script starts by defining an array of products, with the first product being a sneaker product with various properties such as the company name "Sneaker Company", the product name "Fall Limited Edition Sneakers", a description, a price, a discount, and a percentage.
It also defines a variable "currency" which is a html entity for dollar sign.

The script then defines several variables that reference specific elements on the HTML page, such as "product", "thumbnails", "prev", "next", "minus", "plus", "quantity", "addToCart", "name", "company", "hamburger", "hamburgerMenu", "menuClose", "description", "amount", "discount", "percentage", "cartIcon", "chartCounter" and so on. 
These variables will be used later on in the script to manipulate the elements on the page.

The script uses querySelector, getElementsByClassName and getElementById to select and grab the elements from the HTML.

Then it defines various functions that handle specific events such as:

* prev.onclick = function(): This function handles the event of clicking the "previous" button and changes the current image to the previous one in the product's preview array.

* next.onclick = function(): This function handles the event of clicking the "next" button and changes the current image to the next one in the product's preview array.

* minus.onclick = function(): This function handles the event of clicking the "minus" button and decreases the quantity of the product by 1.

* plus.onclick = function(): This function handles the event of clicking the "plus" button and increases the quantity of the product by 1.

* addToCart.onclick = function(): This function handles the event of clicking the "Add to Cart" button and adds the current product to the cart with the specified quantity.

* hamburger.onclick = function(): This function handles the event of clicking the hamburger icon and displays the hamburger menu.

* menuClose.onclick = function(): This function handles the event of clicking the "menu close" button and hides the hamburger menu.

* cartIcon.onclick = function(): This function handles the event of clicking the "cart icon" and displays the cart.
